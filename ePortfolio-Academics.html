    <p>Traditional is not a word I would use to describe myself, nor is it a word that I would use to describe my educational experience. In my sophomore year of college, I was selected to join the Keleher Research Group (KRG) on a project further understanding the chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process. My role in the project was to further understand the mechanisms behind surface-energy interactions between wafers and colloidal dispersions (slurry) and propose mechanistic models for said interactions. I found enjoyment in the hours-long spent on data analysis and the data-driven discussion that ensued. Although I found myself invigorated with the data collection and presentation processes, I knew technical lab work was not for me.

    <p>Working in a small consulting firm this summer allowed me to better use my data analytics techniques. Methods of data collection and storage were outdated, and I helped implement new systems for better organization on Excel and created a user-friendly database for project navigation. I found enjoyment in process of acquiring, cleaning, and using the data which further ignited my interest in the data science field.  Also, as part of the research, I was tasked with at the consulting firm, I had to access the City of Chicago data portal to compile relevant information related to building permits and business licenses to assist our clients.

    <p>After I revealed my passion for data science and all the topics it encompassed, I registered for programming coursework and became skilled in Python, R, SQL, statistical learning and modeling, along with cloud computing and machine learning. My final capstone project focused on using liquid crystal (L.C.) sensor technology to combat the growing problem of laser attacks on private, commercial, and federal airlines. Using libraries like Matplotlib and Pandas in Python, I was able to extrapolate and statistically analyze data from the Federal Administration Aviation (FAA) and JMP to further model and manipulate data to draw correlations between optical properties in lasers to liquid crystals used for light polarization.  Using HTML and CSS, I published a webpage summarizing my project results along with my GitHub to allow for further data discussion and programming critiquing. This experience has not only taught me how to effectively pose and answer my research questions but also how to defend these findings by incorporating a false experience, controls, and event study in my analysis.

    <p>My love and interest in this topic are reflected in my academic success, as I discovered who I was as a person and scientist, I was able to better understand and rationalize my coursework material.  Apart from academics and research, I’ve also taken my academic learning to a mentoring level. Since 2018, I have been an active member in scientific community outreach around the Chicagoland area, involved in events ranging from judging elementary/middle school science fairs to performing chemistry demonstrations to help young children. My goal is to inspire others, especially Latina women like myself, to find their passion for S.T.E.M. just like my research mentor and P.I., Dr. Jason Keleher, helped me. I extended my mentoring work to my school where I worked as a General Chemistry II Lab research mentor. Furthermore, I immerse myself in enriching global experiences such as using my Spanish to communicate with people from a variety of upbringings and encourage them by telling them my story in the S.T.E.M. field to push for greater diversity and more inclusivity within the data science community.

    The Master of Data Science Program at the University of Chicago would help me become a leader that pushes for diversity, creativity, and innovation in my career. I look forward to studying under renowned scholars such as Dr. Gizem Aydin. As a graduate student, I want exposure to multiple facets of data science topics that go beyond the complex analytics and dive into the societal and philosophical aspects of data science. Academic success is an integral part of my personal grad-student experience, but I argue that enhancing leadership and communication skills, understanding analytical tools with practical applications, and career and professional guidance is just as beneficial, which the University of Chicago promises. I want to expand my knowledge of programming skills in languages like Python for machine learning in coursework such as MSCA 37014: Python for Analytics. I recently moved to the south side of Chicago and have seen first-hand the educational segregation within our city. Joining clubs like Ethics Club would allow me to vocalize my ideas on using machine learning to improve S.T.E.M. education and eliminate the education gap in underprivileged communities within our Chicago neighborhoods. For all these reasons, the M.S. data analytics program is the best possible opportunity for my postgraduate education and experience.

    Throughout college, my favorite experiences have always centered around data analysis and discourse. Collaboration is critical to innovation which I hope to improve upon by challenging me with the multifaceted coursework material in data science at the University of Chicago. As A.I. continues to revolutions every industry, many of the manual and labor-intensive jobs that Latino immigrants occupy will be all automated. To prevent an economic calamity in the future, we must start investing in education now. Given the opportunity, I plan on contributing to the University of Chicago community, the communities of Chicago, and global communities with an energetic passion for data-driven discussion and analysis along with breaking stereotypes and progressing inclusivity as a student and alum. Attending the University of Chicago would prepare me to be a leader, mentor, and forerunner in innovation which is why I would not describe myself as traditional. No, I would describe myself as what I hope my educational experience and career to be, extraordinary.
